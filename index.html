<p>
A computer vision system comprises several fundamental steps to process visual data effectively. The first step is <b>Image Acquisition</b>, where the system captures images or video frames from cameras or sensors. This data collection phase is crucial as it forms the foundation for all subsequent processing.<br>

Following image acquisition, we enter the <b>Preprocessing</b> stage. Here, the captured images undergo several operations to prepare them for analysis. Image Enhancement techniques are applied to improve image quality. Adjustments to brightness and contrast, along with noise reduction, are common practices to ensure that the images are as clear and informative as possible.<br>

Image Transformation is another key aspect of preprocessing. It involves resizing, cropping, or rotating images to standardize their format, making them consistent for further analysis. Additionally, this stage may include Feature Extraction, where relevant information is identified and extracted from the images. This often involves detecting edges, key points, or other distinctive features that are essential for the analysis phase.<br>

Finally, we move to the <b>Analysis</b> stage. Here, the preprocessed images are subjected to various operations, including Feature Detection and Pattern Recognition. Feature Detection identifies specific objects, patterns, or keypoints within the images. This is critical for tasks like object tracking or identification. Pattern Recognition utilizes machine learning algorithms to recognize and classify patterns or objects based on the features extracted during preprocessing. This step is central to tasks such as facial recognition or object classification.<br>

The analysis phase concludes with Decision Making, where the computer vision system makes informed decisions or predictions based on the results of the previous steps. This could involve classifying an object within an image, tracking its movement, or providing data for further actions.<br>

In essence, these basic steps—Image Acquisition, Preprocessing, and Analysis—form the core of a computer vision system's operation. They enable the system to process visual data, extract relevant information, and perform a wide range of tasks across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles and beyond.</p>
